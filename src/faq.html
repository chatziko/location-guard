Note: we have a separate .html page for the faq cause all other pages fit in the window's height, but the faq is
scrollable. We need to have the _whole page_ scrollable, cause scrolling only a single div is very slow on mobile. On
the other hand, if the faq page becomes scrollable, then mobile browsers hide the url bar, which changes the window's
height and affect the other pages that use 100% height! Using separate .html files for fixed/scrollable stuff solves the
issue.

					<h3>What is Location Guard?</h3>

					<p>Websites can ask the browser for your location (via JavaScript). When they do so, the browser
					first asks your permission, and if you accept, it detects your location (typically by transmitting a
					list of available wifi access points to a geolocation provider such as Google Location Services, or
					via GPS if available) and gives it to the website.</p>

					<p>Location Guard is a browser extension that intercepts this procedure. The permission dialog
					appears as usual, and you can still choose to deny. If you give permission, then Location Guard
					obtains your location and adds "random noise" to it, creating a fake location. Only the fake
					location is then given to the website.</p>

					<p>To see Location Guard in action use <a href="demo.html">our demo page</a>,
					this <a href="https://browserleaks.com/geo" target="_blank">online demo</a>,
					a <a href="https://forecast.io/" target="_blank">geolocalized weather forecast</a>,
					or go to <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a> / <a href="https://maps.google.com" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>
					and press the <img style="vertical-align: middle" src="images/gmaps_dot.png"/> button.
					When the website asks for your location you will see the <span id="lgIcon"></span> icon,
					which also provides configuration options.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="faq-privacy" data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>What kind of privacy does Location Guard provide?</h3>

					<p>Location Guard provides privacy within a certain <i>protection area</i> by ensuring that all
					locations within this area look <i>plausible</i> for being the real one. This is achieved by adding
					random noise in a way such that all locations within the protection area can produce the same fake
					location with similar probability. As a consequence, the fake location provides no information to
					the website for distinguishing between locations within the protection area.</p>

					<p><b>Warning:</b> <i>background knowledge</i> can still be used by websites to guess the real
					location within the protection area. For instance, if the protection area is in the middle of a lake
					containing only a small island, it will be easy to infer that the real location is on the island. In
					scenarios like this you should choose a higher privacy level or deny disclosing your location at
					all.
				</div>
				<div id="faq-levels" data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>What are "privacy levels"?</h3>

					<p>The privacy level determines the amount of noise added to your real location. A higher level adds
					more noise, so the fake location will be further away from the real one. This offers protection
					within a larger area, but it might make the service provided by the website less useful.</p>

					<p>By default all websites use the "medium" level (this can be changed from the <a
					href="options.html#options">Options tab</a>). You can select a different level for a specific website using
					the <img src="images/pin_19.png"/> icon. For instance, you could select a lower privacy level for
					websites that need an accurate location (eg. maps), and a higher one for websites that only need
					approximate information (eg. weather forecast).</p>

					<p>For more flexibility, each level can be configured from the <a href="options.html#levels">Privacy Levels
					tab</a>. The red circle is the <i>protection area</i>: locations in this area look plausible to
					be the real one (see "<a href="#privacy">What kind of privacy does Location Guard
					provide?</a>"). The blue circle is the <i>accuracy</i>: the fake location will be inside this circle
					with high probability (note that the noise is random). Use the slider to adapt the two areas to your
					needs.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="faq-fixed" data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>What is a "fixed location"?</h3>

					<p>The privacy level can be set to "Use fixed location". In this case Location Guard always reports to the website
					a predefined fixed location that never changes (instead of generating a fake location by adding
					noise to the real one). This offers the highest privacy, since the reported location is completely
					independent from the real one, at the cost of very low accuracy.</p>

					<p>You can modify the fixed location from the <a href="options.html#fixedPos">Fixed Location tab</a>.</p>

					<p>When using a fixed Location, the browser's geolocation is not performed at all. This offers
					better privacy, since the list of wifi access points is not transmitted to Google's servers.
					However, it has the side effect that the <i>permission dialog is not displayed at all</i>.
					This behaviour is usually acceptable when the fixed location is dummy, but it can
					be modified if you wish.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="faq-ip" data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>Why some websites detect my location although I use Location Guard?</h3>

					<p>Some websites
					detect your location based on your
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address" target="_blank">IP address</a> (a numerical label
					associated with every device on the Internet), which is visible to all websites you visit. However, most of the
					time this type of geolocation is <i>not accurate</i> and is limited to the city or postal/zip code level.
					Examples of such websites are <a href="https://www.iplocation.net/" target="_blank">iplocation.net</a> and
					<a href="https://www.tracemyip.org/" target="_blank">tracemyip.org</a>.</p>

					<p>Location Guard does not protect your IP address; it hides the location revealed by the browser
					through the JavaScript API, which is usually <i>very accurate</i>. More information about how the
					browser obtains your location can be found <a
					href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/geolocation/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

					<p>To hide your IP address you need to use some anonymous communication system such as
					<a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank">Tor</a>. Note, however, that even if your IP address is
					hidden, your browser can still reveal your location through JavaScript, so you need to also use Location Guard.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="faq-info" data-role="collapsible">
					<h3>How Location Guard uses my information?</h3>

					<p>Location Guard takes your privacy seriously! First, the extension itself has no "special
					permission" to access your location, it can obtain it only when a website asks for it and only if
					you allow access in the permission dialog.</p>

					<p>Location Guard runs locally in your browser and <i>sends no information</i> whatsoever to the
					network. It only communicates your fake location to the website that asks for it.</p>

					<p>Location Guard also never stores your real location. The <i>fake</i> location is cached for a
					small period of time; if a website asks for your location during this time the cached fake location
					will be returned. This improves privacy by avoiding to generate too many fake locations which
					would be centered around the real one. The cache period can be configured from the <a
					href="options.html#levels">Privacy Levels tab</a> and the cache can be deleted from
					the <a href="options.html#options">Options tab</a>.

					<h3>What is the technology behind Location Guard?</h3>

					<p>Location Guard is a product of research carried out at the Ecole Polytechnique of Paris,
					CNRS and Inria. It is based on work by <a href="https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~mandres" target="_blank">Miguel Andrés</a>,
					<a href="http://www.nbordenabe.me/" target="_blank">Nicolás Bordenabe</a>,
					<a href="https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~kostas/" target="_blank">Kostas Chatzikokolakis</a>,
					<a href="https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~catuscia/" target="_blank">Catuscia Palamidessi</a> and
					<a href="http://www.stronati.org/" target="_blank">Marco Stronati</a>.</p>

					<p>Location Guard implements a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location_obfuscation" target="_blank">location obfuscation</a>
					technique based on adding noise from a 2-dimensional
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_distribution" target="_blank">Laplace distribution</a>.
					This method can be formally shown to provide a privacy guarantee which is a variant
					of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy" target="_blank">Differential Privacy</a>.
					More details can be found in the paper below.</p>
